Role Variables
**************

There are a large number of role variables that control what settings                     
this role will apply to an Cisco IOS router or switch. If applicable the                  
default value is shown but most variables do not have default values. If                  
a variable is undefined the relevant settings will usually be omitted                     
from the configuration. This may lead to unintended consequences so                       
please read this section carefully.
